Less Intrusive Shields
-------------------------

LIS is a mod for Minecraft which changes the vanilla shields to take up less screen space and be less intrusive. This is especially helpful for livestreamers and builders who require more screen space.

Created by [Vox](http://github.com/WardBenjamin).

Inspired by DireWolf20 and the ForgeCraft2 crew.

Pull Requests

Pull requests with new features, translations, and bugfixes are very welcome. Please make sure to always submit PRs against the ***dev*** branch, not master.

Do not make PRs that are solely formatting or other aesthetic things.

If your PR is going to take a lot of work, it may be best to make an issue so we can discuss the feature before you create it.
